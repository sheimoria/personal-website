      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m Shem, a computer science sophomore who enjoys making fast and
        beautiful things on the web. Besides technology, I also have a knack for
        design; check out how I&apos;ve been exploring these two interests of
        mine below! But of course, there&apos;s much to learn and do, so feel
        free to connect with me if there&apos;s an opportunity for us to
        discover something together!
      </p>
      <p>Have a great day!</p>
